# Glossary of operations and terms

## View

A view represents a held belief by an individual. (maybe a couple of extra sentences)

## Default Reasoning Procedure

All operations take an initial view, and take on board a second view through the lens of the first, to produce a third view.

## Update

First View: Currently active point of view
Second View: Treated as a fact
Conclusion: New active point of view

Take a starting view, and when provided a new perspective produces a third view. (more details, reference glossary)
