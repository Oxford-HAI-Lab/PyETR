# Reference

The following collection of pages were automatically generated based on the code. They describe each of the available [cases](./case_index.md), [operations](./view_methods.md) and [inference methods](./inference_index.md). This is a subset of those available in the code, but we've only excluded those that we felt wouldn't be useful to a user of PyETR.
