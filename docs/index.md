# PyETR

Welcome to the PyETR documentation!

PyETR is a Python implementation of the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) as presented in the book *Reason & Inquiry*, OUP 2023.
From [the publisher](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reason-and-inquiry-9780198823766?cc=gb&lang=en&#):

!!! quote
    Reason and Inquiry: The Erotetic Theory presents a unified theory of the human capacity for reasoning and decision-making. The erotetic theory accounts for a diverse range of empirically documented fallacies and framing effects. It shows how the same mental processes that yield fallacies can yield what logicians call first-order validity and probabilistic coherence in reasoning, as well as rational decision-making as conceived by economists.

    The book's central idea is that our minds naturally aim at resolving issues, and if we are sufficiently inquisitive in the process, we can avoid mistakes. The erotetic theory holds that both the successes and the failures of reason are due to this aim. Rationality is secured if we reach what is described by the theory as erotetic equilibrium.

For different users we recommend different entry points in the documentation.

- If you are not familiar with ETR, it may be helpful to start with the !!Overview!!. Then you may wish to head to [Installation](getting_started/installation.md) and then start picking up the system [Examples](getting_started/example.md).
- If you want to use PyETR to help your start *Reason & Inquiry* should read !!Systems!!

See the [Introduction](introduction) for a quick orientation and important information for readers of the book.

Here you'll find details of how to install the package, get started using it and details of advanced usage.
