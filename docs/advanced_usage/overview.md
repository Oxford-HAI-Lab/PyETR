# Advanced Usage

If you're reading this, you should probably have read and feel you have a good understanding of the [Usage](../usage/first_steps.md) section, and ideally also the [Theory](../theory/overview.md) section. We're about to take a look "under the hood" of PyETR, looking at topics such as:

- How to define your own [inference operations](./defining_inference.md) and [numeric functions](./func_callers.md)

- How to [inspect the constituent operations](./troubleshooting.md) that make up larger operations like [Update](../reference/view_methods.md#update)

- What [equality](./view_equality_and_equivalence.md) means in PyETR, and how it may differ from what you would have expected.
